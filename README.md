# Testing dataset Filters

## Objectives

- Write a unit test to test filter integration

## Instructions

In this repo we've got the same setup as our last lab. We've got a `ContactController` with 150 contacts in it.

Let's test out that we can filter this large dataset.

Write various different tests that search for different aspects of our contacts - for instance, write a test to return all the males (there are 71 females and 79 miles). You can also write one to select people from different geographical locations (hint: there are 8 from Manchester).
